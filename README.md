MobileDev
=========
So I will be honest, the project was much more difficult than I had expected. I easly spent 25+ hours working on it 
since the project was assigned. Much of that is due to no prior Android expereince, so it is to be expected. Another 
part was having all instructions in Swift, which complicated the process as swift and java have vastly different 
capabilities.

The project started off fine, and at the begining I felt like the programmer who, occasionally, when nobody's home,
turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their
computer. It's a different file for everyone. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to
save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of
the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.

This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It's concise. It doesn't do
anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one,
mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It 
reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.

I started out writing a perfect little android snowflake like this. Then I'm told on Friday I need 
to have six hundred snowflakes written by Tuesday, so I rush a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes
and try to stick them together or ask a friend to help on one, who then melts it and then all my
snowflakes get dumped together in some inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see
the cat urine soaking into all my broken snowflakes melting in the light of day. Next week, everybody shovels more
snow on it to keep the Picasso from falling over.

That about sums up my experience with MVC. I had no idea what it was to start with, and trying to copy swift code led
to a snowball effect of my code getting progressivly more off track and painful to look at. After several refactors it
began to come around, and especially after meeting with you the MVC started to make sense.

TL;DR
I had A+ effort, but as far as quality of project probably a B.
